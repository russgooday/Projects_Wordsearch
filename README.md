## Wordsearch
Some years ago I needed to home school my daughter, then about 7 years old. To supplement her English lessons, I decided to write a script to generate printable wordsearches that she could colour in.

The script included a very basic jquery-like framework to handle selections, add events and trigger transitions.

I did refactor the code about 5 years ago and with the knowledge I have attained since then it is certainly a candidate for another refactoring and some modernising.
